# Advent of Code 2021

This is where I'm keeping my work on the 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Obviously, puzzle spoilers are contained herein, so tread cautiously if you care about that.

### Solutions:

These are links to tags in my git history as I've decided not to organize all the days in the repo this year.

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Day</th>
    <th>Solution</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>One</td>
      <td>
        <a href="https://github.com/aderickson/adventofcode-2021/blob/day-1-combined/src/solutions.rs" target="_blank">day-1</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Two</td>
      <td>
        <a href="https://github.com/aderickson/adventofcode-2021/blob/day-2/src/solutions.rs" target="_blank">day-2</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
